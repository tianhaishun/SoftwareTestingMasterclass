### Basics of Software Testing

#### What is Software Testing?

Software testing is a process that evaluates the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect-free in order to produce a quality product.

##### Example

Consider a simple web form where a user needs to register by inputting their name, email, and password. Software testing in this case could involve:

- **Functional Testing**: Testing the functionality of the form, such as checking if a user can successfully register with valid inputs, or if the form correctly rejects invalid inputs (such as a malformed email or a too-short password).
- **Usability Testing**: Testing the form's user-friendliness, such as checking if the form is easy to understand and use, or if there are helpful error messages when the user makes a mistake.
- **Security Testing**: Testing the form for security vulnerabilities, such as checking if the password is being securely hashed and not just stored in plaintext.

##### Exercise

Find a web form (it could be a login form, a sign-up form, a contact form, etc.) and perform the above tests. Write down the steps you took, the test results, and any issues you found.
## Basics of Software Testing

### What is Software Testing?

Software testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous. Software bugs can potentially cause monetary and human loss, and history is full of such examples.

##### Example

In 1996, a software bug in the Ariane 5 Flight 501 caused the rocket to self-destruct 37 seconds after launch, leading to a loss of more than $370 million. The bug was in the Inertial Reference System software, which was reused from the Ariane 4. The software tried to convert a 64-bit floating-point number to a 16-bit signed integer, but the number was too large, causing an overflow error. This incident highlights the importance of thorough software testing, especially when reusing existing software components.

##### Exercise

Research another real-world example of a costly or dangerous software bug. Write a brief report detailing what the bug was, what caused it, what the consequences were, and how it could have been prevented with better software testing.

### Importance of Software Testing

There are different stages for software testing process. The basic types of testing are: Functional Testing, Non-functional Testing, and Maintenance (Regression and Maintenance).

##### Example

Let's consider testing for a social media application like Instagram:

- **Functional Testing**: Testing the core functions of the app, like posting a picture, liking a post, or following a user.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Testing non-functional aspects like app speed, load time, and user interface.
- **Maintenance**: After the software delivery, checking the modifications and updates in the application.

##### Exercise

Pick an application you use every day. Identify and write down at least one example for each type of testing: functional, non-functional, and maintenance.

### Software Testing Life Cycle

Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) defines the steps/stages/phases in testing of software. However, there isnâ€™t a fixed standard STLC in the world and it basically varies from one organization to another. The different stages in Software Testing Life Cycle are: Requirement Analysis, Test Planning, Test Case Development, Environment Setup, Test Execution, and Test Cycle Closure.

##### Example

Consider the development and testing of a new feature for a web application:

- **Requirement Analysis**: Business requirements are reviewed. Testability of the requirements is checked.
- **Test Planning**: Test strategy is defined. Estimation of testing effort is done.
- **Test Case Development**: Test cases and test scripts are created. Test data is generated.
- **Environment Setup**: Test environment setup is done.
- **Test Execution**: Test cases are executed.
- **Test Cycle Closure**: Testing is completed. Test metrics and test closure report are prepared.

##### Exercise

Think of a small feature or change you'd like to see in a software application you use regularly. Write down how you would go through each stage of the Software Testing Life Cycle for this feature or change.

### Common Software Testing Techniques

Software Testing Techniques help you design better test cases. They help identify test conditions that are otherwise hard to recognize. In this course, you will learn about the most commonly used software testing techniques.

##### Example

Suppose you're testing a simple calculator application. Some testing techniques you might use include:

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: If you're testing the calculator's addition function, you might identify "equivalence classes" of inputs to test, such as two positive numbers, a positive number and a negative number, two negative numbers, etc.
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: You might test the limits of the calculator's input range to see how it handles extremely large or small numbers.
- **Decision Table Testing**: You could create a table with different combinations of inputs and their expected outputs.

##### Exercise

Pick a simple software application or feature and write down how you would apply each of the above testing techniques.
